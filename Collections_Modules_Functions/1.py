# What is List? How will you reverse a list?

'''
A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements.
Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item. Just as strings are defined as characters between quotes,
lists are defined by having values between square brackets [ ] .



we'll reverse a list using two methods :

first one is built in function reverse()
and second one is using slicing method
