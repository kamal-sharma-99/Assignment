Anonymous Functions (Lambda Functions): These are small, anonymous functions defined using the lambda keyword. They can have any number of parameters but only one expression. Lambda functions are often used when you need a simple function for a short period of time.

These are the basic types of functions available in Python, but there are other advanced types of functions as well, such as recursive functions, higher-order functions, etc
